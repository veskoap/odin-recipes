RECIPES PROJECT

This project will be a very basic HTML only website that will
demonstrate what I have learned so far from the Odin Project
coursework.

It will include the the following
-standard HTML 5 boilerplate
- <title>, <body>, <p> tags
- <strong> (Bold) and <em> (Italicized) elements
- <ul> unordered lists and <ol> ordered lists
- absolute and relative links using <a>
- images using <img>
